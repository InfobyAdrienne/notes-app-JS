# Notes App 

### Description 
Using pure JavaScript to create a single page web app. Our MVP is completing User Story 1 and 2.

### User Stories 
```
USER STORY 1
As a programmer  
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters  
So I can find the one I want  

USER STORY 2
As a programmer  
I can create a new note  
So I can record something I need to remember  

USER STORY 3  
As a programmer  
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page  
So I can see all the information in the note  

USER STORY 4  
As a programmer  
I can use shortcodes like `:fire:` that get converted into emojis like ðŸ”¥  
So I can record notes with fun little pictures

USER STORY 5
As a programmer  
I can refresh the page and still see my notes  
So I can remember what I took down
```
